Having established a historical framework, the course offers six contemporary topics to be discussed in the remainder of the semester. Topics may include, but not be limited to: the commercial mass media; the public relations industry; gender in advertising; commercialization of childhood; the commercialization of medicine and science; contemporary consumer society; advertising in schools; and food, advertising, and body image.",
